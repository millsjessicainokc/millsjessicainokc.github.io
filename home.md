# My blog

Hi my name is Jessica. This is my very first blog. This is my first week of coding school. I am a newbie to the tech world. It has been very exciting to me as well as very nerve racking and overwhelming. What I will say has helped me so far is the app called Trello. Its very simple to set up and use for school and home life. Trello lets you make different lists, name them what you want. For example I named mine: working-on, due, past-due and done. So lets say I am working on something like a blog then I will have a tab called ‘a blog’ inside the working on tab. When I am done I can move the tab ‘a blog’ to my done tab. So far it has helped me stay on track of what needs to be done. I still don’t know what I am doing, I am trying to learn something new everyday.  I am sure all this will make sense eventually.
